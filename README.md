Our project utilizes a structured Git branching model to streamline development and maintain code quality. The primary branches are:

main: Contains production-ready code. Only thoroughly tested and approved changes are merged here.

develop: A development branch where active development occurs. Features and fixes are integrated here before testing.

testing: Also known as the QA branch, this is where code from the develop branch is tested. Once validated, it's promoted to the main branch.
